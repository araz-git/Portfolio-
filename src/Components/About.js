      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a passionate front-end developer interested in solving problems for
        the end user. I prefer using React in my work. I also have solid
        knowledge of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, MySQL, Linux, API, Node JS and other
        technologies. I love making apps for my personal use. You can find some
        of them on my github account. Some of the projects were a website for
        English learners, a platform for teaching art, a lot of landing pages,
        and other projects.
        <br />
        I have experience working in different positions in the IT industry, and
        I know that front-end is the most enjoyable thing for me. I love making
        apps for my personal development. I enjoy spending time improving the
        quality of my everyday life by creating apps for my household's use.
        <br />
        I have worked as a Linux engineer at Timeweb, where I learned more about
        server structure and got a better understanding of Linux and other
        useful tools for work. I resolved many different website and server
        issues for the company's customers and helped them with problems they
        encountered while using the company's products. There could be problems
        with their website's load time, MySQL database, not working correctly
        CMS plugins, and misplaced files of their websites, and many more.
        <br />
        I have worked as a product manager as well. This experience helped me
        understand customers more since I was doing CustDev interviews. I have
        talked with more than 500 customers. This knowledge helped me reduce the
        costs of our marketing campaigns.
        <br />
        I also used programming to help the product management department by
        automating the mailing process. I used Python to automatically load data
        from a MySQL database, clean it up via RegEx, and send the appropriate
        messages to the clients. This was a task I was doing as a product
        manager, and I enjoyed working on it so much that I decided to become a
        front-end developer.
        <br />
        I have good people skills as well. I have worked as an English teacher,
        and communication with others is something that I am experienced in and
        something that I was taught how to do.
        <br />I also speak English (C-2), German (B-2), Spanish (B-1), Azeri and
        Russian (native)
